# Sony GPS Assist Data windows batch file updater
Copy the gps_update.bat in the root directory from your SD-card, and run it.
It will create the sub directory if needed and download all needed files and then checks the download for corruption.

This should run on all versions of windows, as it uses build in methods, no additional installations needed!
